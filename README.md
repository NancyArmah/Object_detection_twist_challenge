# Image Classification using CNN

The goal of this project is to create a live produce detection that would detect if the produce from the market was rotten (mould, discoloured) or fresh.

This CNN was built using transfer learning and the Keras Tensorflow Library.

The Data for this classification problem was taken from google images by performing a simple image search and using a chrome extension called 'image downloader' to automatically detect images on the web page displayed to enable download.
